# Optimization of Quantum Repeater Chains

This repository now extends the original algorithm introduced in "Efficient optimization of cut‑offs in quantum repeater chains" (Li, Coopmans & Elkouss 2021) with the extensions presented in "Bayesian Optimization for Repeater Protocols" (La Corte, Goodenough, Maity, Santra & Elkouss 2025).

(i) The original work includes two implementations: 
- The numerical algorithm calculating the waiting time distribution and the fidelity of the delivered entangled state.
- The optimizer used to optimize the cut-off time for maximal secret key rate.

(ii) The extension adds:
- A more general version of the algorithm: any number of nodes and heterogeneous hardware parameters are supported.
- A Bayesian optimizer searches for the optimal protocols without brute‑forcing.

## Tutorial (Original Repository) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BoxiLi/repeater-cut-off-optimization/master)

A tutorial is written in Jupyter Notebook. By clicking the badge above, you will be directed to an online Jupyter Notebook. After the loading succeeds, please find and click `tutorial.ipynb`. Then you can run examples in the notebook online without installing anything! (The loading can take a few minutes. It takes too long, please try again half an hour later.)
The tutorial is relative to the original work of (Li, Coopmans & Elkouss 2021).

## Setup
(Suggested) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproduce Results

1) To reproduce (Li, Coopmans & Elkouss 2021) results, refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/BoxiLi/repeater-cut-off-optimization)
2) To reproduce (La Corte, Goodenough, Maity, Santra & Elkouss 2025) results, once the environment has been set up, run:
```bash
chmod +x ./src/scripts/reproduce_results.sh
source ./src/scripts/reproduce_results.sh
```
or (dockerized version):
```bash
docker build -t bopt-runner .
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/results:/app/results" bopt-runner
```

## File overview
- The core code for the numerical simulation of repeater chains is under `core/repeater_algorithm.py`.
- The protocol units such as entanglement swap, distillation or cut-off are defined in `core/protocol_units.py` and `core/protocol_unit_efficient.py`. The later makes use of customized convolution in Fourier space.
- (New!) The extended version of the algorithm works representing protocols using the full binary trees class defined in `types/protocol_types.py`.
- The cut-off optimizer can be found in `optimization/optimize_cutoff.py`.
- (New!) The Bayesian optimization logic is implemented in the files `optimization/gp_*.py`.
